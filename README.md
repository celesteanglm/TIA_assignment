# TIA_assignment

This is my submission for Tech In Asia's Data Engineering/Scientist recruitment assignment.

## Overview

1. Data scraping from the API is in `data_collection.py`
2. Data analysis/visualization was done in `TIA_data_analysis.ipynb`. For easy viewing without the need to download Jupyter Notebook, view the file in github directly, or download the `TIA_data_analysis.html` file and view it in your internet browser.
3. Scraped data is stored in the `data` folder
4. The `output` folder contains output from data visualizations.
5. The `test` folder contains tests for models built.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install `anaconda` URL: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/
2. open `environment.yml` with a text editor, change the `prefix` path to the path of your anaconda distribution
3. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
