Rule of thumb should be one relatively successful founder and one failed founder in the portfolio. For newer VCs, talk to at least one LP and/or one of the GPs ex-employer.

435889,315594,Discuss: Is 5 years enough to change the culture in a large organization?,https://www.techinasia.com/talk/discuss-is-5-years-enough-to-change-the-culture-in-a-large-organization,"<p>For culture change, I find it useful to look at the work of Harvard Kennedy School professor Ronald Heifetz, known for the theory of “adaptive leadership.”Heifetz formerly worked as an emergency room doctor. One night a woman came in, having been badly beaten by her husband. Heifetz patched her up, and she left. A few months later, she came in again, with the same situation. Heifetz patched her up, and sent her out again. A few more months went by, and she came in again for a third time, beaten again. This time, Heifetz asked the woman why it was that she remained in this relationship that was clearly a threat to her safety. She responded, “growing up, my father beat my mother. If I left my husband, I would be sending the message to my parents that I did not approve of their relationship.” Heifetz saw in that moment that while he could fix the woman’s wounds, the root of the problem was complex, and only she could solve it herself.The case of the woman illustrates two different kinds of problems that we face in life and business, with two different types of solutions: technical and adaptive. With technical challenges, there is a clear problem with a clear solution. Therefore, the “expert” or “leader” just needs to get the people out of the way so that they can solve it, or direct people to follow their orders. With adaptive challenges, the problem is not always clear, making the solution even less clear. In this case, the people are the problem, but the people are also the solution.For technical challenges, a leader needs to operate like a surgeon, for adaptive ones, they need to operate like a psychologist. When it comes to culture change, it is almost always an adaptive challenge. For tech firms and technical professionals, solving technical problems is usually what they’re best at, and when it comes to culture change, they sometimes tend to approach that as a technical problem as well, which is a mistake.</p>

430978,315210,Discuss: Why the cryptocurrency discussion is going nowhere,https://www.techinasia.com/talk/why-cryptocurrency-discussion-going-nowhere,"<p>In my opinion we’re still debating the value of two things that look the same but are not in use, and today can not be in use, by the same groups of people.</p>
</p>
<p>Take an analogy – cloud block storage is great, of high value to specific groups of people (devs and hobbyists) and has seen stunning growth in its niche; Dropbox arguably has similar functionalities (especially with its API) but was designed to be more accessible from the beginning as it’s purpose is slightly different.</p>
</p>
<p>Now, I use both cloud block storage and Dropbox, but my mother only uses Dropbox, but not cloud block storage. Her reasons are those of (a) access, (b) utility, and (c) purpose.</p>
</p>
<p>Despite how technically beautiful cloud block storage is, she (a) has no idea how to turn it on, (b) no real reason to use it, and (c) no understanding of how this will be better for her than Dropbox.</p>
</p>
<p>Similarly, cryptocurrencies are currently the fancy of developers (because of how technically beautiful they are) and hobbyists (financial people that think they understand technology :-p ), but the average fiat currency users lack (a) any ability to buy crypto easily, (b) any real ways to use it beyond investment at this stage, and (c) any understanding of why this is better to *invest* in than gold or tech stocks.</p>
</p>
<p>(A) Access</p>
</p>
<p>I say access is a problem because the average user is not going to mine the currency. Also, buying bitcoin in most countries requires serious motivation as access is still the same now as it was 4 years ago – you still have to act like a degenerate drug buyer, and meet random suppliers in coffee shops and swap cash. There are a few other ways to get in, but until I can Google my way into using my credit card to buy coin, we should consider access a problem.</p>
</p>
<p>(B) Purpose</p>
</p>
<p>Why should anyone buy any crypto currency if they can’t spend it anywhere? Or at least cash it out in the same why they do market  investments? Without any real reason or way to properly use it, it will remain something cool for hobbyists. Also, I can keep getting more of any fiat currency I want very, very easily. You don’t see people in Asia stressing about spending their USD, because they know they can just change and get some more – from their local mall as well!</p>
</p>
<p>(C) Utility</p>
</p>
<p>My current fiat currency does everything I need it to, my local corner shop understands it, and I can pay for stuff without jumping through hoops. It has clear benefits for me, but the average user can’t see the same thing with crypto currencies.</p>
</p>

","In my opinion we’re still debating the value of two things that look the same but are not in use, and today can not be in use, by the same groups of people.Take an analogy – cloud block storage is great, of high value to specific groups of people (devs and hobbyists) and has seen stunning growth in its niche; Dropbox arguably has similar functionalities (especially with its API) but was designed to be more accessible from the beginning as it’s purpose is slightly different.Now, I use both cloud block storage and Dropbox, but my mother only uses Dropbox, but not cloud block storage. Her reasons are those of (a) access, (b) utility, and (c) purpose.Despite how technically beautiful cloud block storage is, she (a) has no idea how to turn it on, (b) no real reason to use it, and (c) no understanding of how this will be better for her than Dropbox.Similarly, cryptocurrencies are currently the fancy of developers (because of how technically beautiful they are) and hobbyists (financial people that think they understand technology :-p ), but the average fiat currency users lack (a) any ability to buy crypto easily, (b) any real ways to use it beyond investment at this stage, and (c) any understanding of why this is better to *invest* in than gold or tech stocks.(A) AccessI say access is a problem because the average user is not going to mine the currency. Also, buying bitcoin in most countries requires serious motivation as access is still the same now as it was 4 years ago – you still have to act like a degenerate drug buyer, and meet random suppliers in coffee shops and swap cash. There are a few other ways to get in, but until I can Google my way into using my credit card to buy coin, we should consider access a problem.(B) PurposeWhy should anyone buy any crypto currency if they can’t spend it anywhere? Or at least cash it out in the same why they do market  investments? Without any real reason or way to properly use it, it will remain something cool for hobbyists. Also, I can keep getting more of any fiat currency I want very, very easily. You don’t see people in Asia stressing about spending their USD, because they know they can just change and get some more – from their local mall as well!(C) UtilityMy current fiat currency does everything I need it to, my local corner shop understands it, and I can pay for stuff without jumping through hoops. It has clear benefits for me, but the average user can’t see the same thing with crypto currencies.I believe that if we can crack the access issue – both buying and spending, pretty much everything else can be toppled. It will also bring a level of stability to the environment. I appreciate there is lots of debate about which currency is better, bla bla bla, but realistically everything for the average use boils down to branding.

427157,314755,Opinion: Apple’s iPhone X storage options are a cruel joke,https://www.techinasia.com/opinion-apples-iphone-storage-options-cruel-joke,"<p>I’m aware that there’s a difference in cost, and originally I had a line in the article about that. I took it out, though, because I don’t think it matters, for a few reasons:</p>
<p><p>First, what I’m talking about there is the user’s needs, not the cost to Apple. If Apple started iPod Classic storage options at 80 GB and then went <em>up</em> from there, they must have thought that might not be enough storage for some users, right? Some iPod users would only need 80 GB, but some would need more. OK. But ten years later, they offer <em>less</em> storage on a device that does a <em>lot</em> more and that often deals with <em>way</em> bigger files. So, <strong>f</strong><strong>orgetting about the comparative cost, can you make an argument as to why an iPhone X user in 2017 would need <em>less</em> storage space than an iPod classic user in 2007?</strong></p>
<p><p>Second, the cost comparison isn’t as black-and-white as you’re suggesting anyway. HDDs have always been cheaper than solid-state storage, yes. But were HDDs in 2007 cheaper than SSDs in late 2017? I’m not as sure. Obviously neither of us have historical data on what Apple’s suppliers were charging. But some charts I found like <a href=""https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-cost-per-gigabyte/"" rel=""nofollow"" rel='nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>this one</a> suggest HDD storage may have been as much as 10x more expensive per GB in 2007 than it is now for industrial-scale buyers. And of course, over the past ten years, the price of SSDs has also fallen dramatically. </p>
<p><p>I’m guessing even with all of that, 80GB of HDD in 2007 might have cost Apple slightly less than 80 GB of SSD would today. But even that doesn’t really matter, because….</p>
<p><p>Third, the iPhone X costs <strong>4x</strong> what an 80 GB iPhone Classic cost. Apple, at least historically, tends to sell its hardware with massive profit margins. Thanks to those margins, Apple also has hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. Given all of that, do we <em>really</em> think that the decision to start the iPhone X at 64 GB was driven by Apple’s inability to make a higher-storage option <em>financially</em> viable? I don’t find that very likely.</p>

<p><strong>BOOTCAMPS VS DEGREES</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>They don’t produce engineers, 4-year computer science programs produce engineers. 3 months bootcamps at best produce relatively clueless light all developers who now know how to search for the right information.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bootcamps produce engineers. Computer science programs produce engineers. The difference is that computer science programs provide a lot more knowledge, the large majority of which is not necessary or irrelevant for software engineering.</p>
<p>I’m going to paraphrase the author of Cracking the Coding Interview, <a href=""https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@gayle?source=post_header_lockup"" rel=""nofollow"" rel='nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>Gayle Laakmann McDowell</a>, from <a href=""https://medium.freecodecamp.org/so-that-whole-coding-bootcamp-thing-is-a-scam-right-6fddf14087d4"" rel=""nofollow"" rel='nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>this post</a>. I encourage you to read it. This is a person who has interviewed hundreds of software candidates for companies all over the country, including Google.</p>
<p>Essentially, her point is that the computer science major can be boiled down to ~14 classes, once the general studies courses that universities require are removed. Of those, ~10 are electives, math, and low-level architecture, which are not necessary. This leaves 4 classes, which is completely feasible for 3 months of directed study. If you don’t believe that 4 classes is all that’s necessary, take a look at the article I linked above.</p>
<p>Of course, bootcamp students will miss some stuff, but “That’s fair, since their goal is to create programmers, not academics. They’ll replace that “missing” stuff with a lot of more practical knowledge.”</p>
<p>Yes, people with CS degrees have much more experience than bootcamp grads. After all, it’s 3 months vs. 4 years. That 3 months, however, is packed with the most relevant industry knowledge possible. It’s also ridiculously cheaper than a 4-year degree.</p>
<blockquote><p>Companies have to be willing to take a chance on these people, and bootcamps are now closing because that gap in the market is closing. Companies now need solid engineers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s true that these grads will be very junior. However, that isn’t a fault of bootcamps. These people need time to get better and to hone their skills. However, I can speak with experience that they come out with skills necessary to do well as developers if they start working right away.</p>
<p><strong>MY EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>I attended a bootcamp right after finishing my undergraduate degree. I got a higher-paying job in less time than most of my friends. I was surprised, but it made sense. I had spent 3 months working 60 hours/week, learning material that was built to jump-start my career into modern software engineering. It worked.</p>
<p>Many of the students in the bootcamp I’m currently teaching will get a job within a few months of graduating. They’re quite good. They can build full applications on their own at this point.</p>
<p><strong>FINANCIAL ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Also, the financial analysis of taking or not taking a boot camp is inherently flawed because it assumes that you’ll just go and get a job afterwards. And that you’ll stay at it. And that you’re even good enough to do it, and the company was willing to take a chance on you.</p></blockquote>
<p>My article was aimed at people who want to get a job in software engineering. I assume that they’ll apply for jobs as soon as they can and stay at it. If they don’t, then of course, a bootcamp is a $10,000 sinkhole. Same goes for a college degree, but with a much bigger number.</p>
<p>Yes, a company has to take a chance on you. It’s a slightly bigger chance than it is for a university graduate. Yes, you have to be good and applying for jobs has to become your full-time job.</p>
<p>If someone has trouble getting a job out of a bootcamp, they would have had trouble getting a job after self-study as well. It evens out.</p>
<p>As I mention in the article, it won’t work out for some. For the large majority of dedicated, intelligent bootcamp students, it will.</p>

423524,314510,Discuss: Singapore is making a universal payment system. But there are better options,https://www.techinasia.com/talk/discuss-singapore-payment-system-better,"<p>Actually it is really not about discovering an ultimate killer robust payment system solution. It is the cost of implementing and using the e-payment for the vendors/seller. No matter how good is your e-payment solution, as long as it is expensive to use, it will never take off.</p>
<p>Assume cost is not a factor, we already have the solution. Just use EZLINK card for everything. All the transport system already implemented, some of the retailer already implemented. Just expand on it. Continue to promote it. Mandate use everywhere. (remember, if cost is not a factor)</p>
<p>Let user easily link their credit cards, giro, debit card to their EZLINK and start using it. It is fast and reasonably secure. Let EZLINK card to become a virtual debit card to purchase items online. </p>
<p>You see we already have the e-payment solution and actually quite established. Why are they not popular? It is the COST of implementation and using it that prevents retailer, hawker from using it.</p>
<p>Imagine, cost of implementing EZLINK system and transaction cost is negligible, tap and buy food at hawker is a breeze. tap to buy items at 7-11 is fast, tap to buy grocery at ntuc, tap to take cab, take bus, tap to pay bill at AXS, tap to pay bill at town council. And if mobile phone is also a EZLINK terminal, you can tap at your friend phone to pay him money.</p>
<p>With linked EZLINK card, everything withdraw from your bank account or credit card. </p>
<p>Sounds good? why need another system.</p>
<p>and of course another reason is selfish commercial entities. “why should i implement the already very established EZLINK system, i want people to use my paylah, i want people to use my singtel dash, i want people to use my ntuc branded credit card, i want people to use my grabpay, i want people to use my razor-payment-system-wannabe”</p>
<p>Need to clarify, i am not from EZLINK or affiliated with EZLINK. It is my opinion that EZLINK has the established network, why not think of how to expand on it. </p>
<p>Or think of revolution ways to reduce the cost of implementing and using e-payment solution. Eg. bitcoin is a very innovative concept of transferring fund cross border without the extortionist bank transaction cost.</p>

You see we already have the e-payment solution and actually quite established. Why are they not popular? It is the COST of implementation and using it that prevents retailer, hawker from using it.
Imagine, cost of implementing EZLINK system and transaction cost is negligible, tap and buy food at hawker is a breeze. tap to buy items at 7-11 is fast, tap to buy grocery at ntuc, tap to take cab, take bus, tap to pay bill at AXS, tap to pay bill at town council. And if mobile phone is also a EZLINK terminal, you can tap at your friend phone to pay him money.
With linked EZLINK card, everything withdraw from your bank account or credit card. 
Sounds good? why need another system.
and of course another reason is selfish commercial entities. “why should i implement the already very established EZLINK system, i want people to use my paylah, i want people to use my singtel dash, i want people to use my ntuc branded credit card, i want people to use my grabpay, i want people to use my razor-payment-system-wannabe”
Need to clarify, i am not from EZLINK or affiliated with EZLINK. It is my opinion that EZLINK has the established network, why not think of how to expand on it. 
Or think of revolution ways to reduce the cost of implementing and using e-payment solution. Eg. bitcoin is a very innovative concept of transferring fund cross border without the extortionist bank transaction cost.",89084,Critical Chipmunk,0,1

<p>Banks (and other providers of payment solutions) should work together to come to a standard. The IDEAL system mentioned in Robin’s post sounds interesting. The point is, there should be no need for a merchant to have three or more credit card machines for different cards. The chip or NFC interfaces are certainly not the reason for that. </p>
<p>The public transport system in London is a great example of how it should be. You tap in and out of the subway or public busses with a card, just like you do with an EZ-Link card in Singapore. But it is not limited to the Oyster cards, the London equivalent to the EZ-Link card. You can use any contactless payment cards issued by banks and credit card providers. Also Apple Pay works flawlessly and I believe Android payment options are supported as well. So instead of searching for a fare card I simply touch the   gate to the subway or the terminal in the bus with my Apple Watch and the fare gets billed to my Amex card. This is very handy if you are carrying a few shopping bags! Of course QR code based payment systems have the advantage that you don’t need a special terminal for payment, but can you imagine the queues to the MRT in the morning if everyone had to capture QR codes at the gate with their smart phone and wait for the gate to receive the payment to enter and exit the MRT stations? How much longer will a bus ride take if users have to snap QR codes with their phones when they board and alight?   </p>
<p>If subway gates and busses can accept all kinds of contactless payment cards and payments via NFC from phones and smart watches, there can be a simple terminal that merchants can use to accept all these forms of payment as well. That is what we need, not yet another payment system.   Of course that requires collaboration between the banks/payment systems, which may have to be encouraged/enforced by the government.</p>

Additionally, I would ask if you have brand loyalty to GRAB or UBER in other markets? They are pretty much commodities offering pretty much the exact same thing, right?That said, in informal polls with locals and drivers, I'm starting to hear that GRAB is winning...both for their ongoing promotions which pretty much gives you free rides everywhere during the day. Also, they are cheaper than UBER and have more drivers. However, UBER drivers seem to be better trained and can read the maps so that makes it easier for us foreigners in the market.",52241,Rita Nguyen,0,0

The title etc is written by TiA staff and wasn’t my actual thoughts as I would use an app over hailing something down most times. </p>
<p>Secondly, I did try to add a card to Grab but it wouldn’t let me on the app. Not sure if I was just trying to do it at a buggy time but not being able to add a card when I wanted to means it wasn’t working when I tried it. </p>
<p>I guess my third point would be that using these apps in these new markets is totally different to say US or UK where you request a ride and the driver pulls up. 95% of the time here, you will request a ride and then the driver calls you to ask where you are… this is where the language barrier becomes apparent. Let these big companies continue to burn VC money on promos, I love the cheap rides and will bounce from whoever is offering them to whoever is offering them for the best deal, the drivers often drive for both anyway.</p>

In fact Uber had to pilot cash acceptance in secondary cities to enable faster customer acquisition. Now of course, both not only accept CC but Grab has a digiwallet ‘Grabpay feature’ with Top-up ability from CC/bank and special promos.

Grab actually does now have in-app translation for it’s messenger, at least in Indonesia. I have often thought that Uber, or Grab and others, which has different sub fleet categories such as Uber X, Premium, etc, could develop a special ‘Traveler’ option with vetted English speaking drivers. While I no longer have personal issues with language/payment for Indonesia I recently noticed in Thailand that even though I didn’t know the language, the services have developed such good processes that the driver and I could still locate each other easily enough with the precision of the map and pick-up location suggestions.</p>

I knew nothing about Entrepreneurship, Social Impact and Startup. I went there with just one intention, Starting Web Design Firm to make money. The first few months in SmallWorld was an amazing journey in life. I felt so much excited and less pressure. However, most people who used the space and even the co-founder of that co-working space did not do anything related to building startup, but we were like playing soccer in the space, playing guitar, made crazy video and upload to Facebook, eating instant noodle, played game, drink fruit shake and go home after 8pm. Then next time after 7am we left home again. Most of our neighbours thought that it would be orphanage or some small NGO that work with street children. It’s not the reason that we didn’t want to do anything but we did not know what to do and how to run startup. We were like having zero knowledge about it.</p>
<p>I have only one website project for 3 months and the money ran out before I could finish the project. Guess how much we charged? That was just $150/website that has more than 20 pages and a lot of dynamic content.</p>
<p>Since then until now I failed more than 3 startups, and lose many friends who I used to co-founded with, dropped off many jobs and lost lots of money. Life changed so much, sometimes could not even find $1 in the pocket and decided to borrow some money from other people until I found that I did not have money to pay the debt, then I took 3 to 6 months to work in any company and dropped the Job again to do another startups. Today, <a href=""http://www.pengpos.com"" rel=""nofollow"" rel='nofollow noopener' target='_blank'>www.pengpos.com</a> is latest project. </p>
<p>One point that I can share, Do Whatever You Love. When you Love it, you will find a way to survive and still persist to do it. Some people love to be working in a good company, some people love the life as freelancer, some people love the life as entrepreneur. Those are true love and they persist to keep doing & growing on what they love. Anyway, your experience is another good point of view. Good luck to you and your future step. 🙂</p>

Many investors wanted to invest in Zoho but Zoho has positive cash flow and they are able to fund their expansions and so they have not taken any of the VCs till date. A rare feat by a startup and that too based in India. The VC community was long looking to invest in Zoho and if not what ? Fund another one that is on the same domain. The same happened with Housing.com.  Those who were not in the “housing.com” bus were trying to create an alternative one to get a piece of the action.  Hence I think Freshdesk was borne out of this problem and so many VCs have invested in it. Zarget would have found itself hard to exist because from the story it appears it just went for a game whose journey and timeline was known and carved out from the very start. The acquisition of “so many” customers etc would have been deliberate to create a story and part of the playbook that was supposed to be played and the play would end at a point as defined by the community who controlled it. So this is not a innovation or startup or value creation game or was ever meant to be. Hence not worth any further discussion. </p></p>

Im in the payment industry too and I can feel suffering during this journey which always happens when doing startup. The best thing is you guys have learned a lot from this experience which you will never get from working as an employer. It seems the final decision to quit was because DBS PayLah joined this game. We have been working with many payment companies all over the world, however, most of them are not run by the traditional banks, and the most successful payment giants like paypal or alipay are not run by the banks too even the banks have much money, and I believe its likely the banks can’t compete with startups when coming to payment industry. Just feel some pity for quitting in short time.</p>
<p>Regarding high barriers for payment industry, as you said, there are no banking api available and card processing fees are high. I have to say they are not friendly indeed, but thats equal for all companies even for the banks. Regarding the card processing fees, you mentioned the fees are capped at 0.2% by regulators in UK, which is not correct. 0.2% is only for the interchange fee, and the total fees for most merchants in North America and Europe are 2-4%. You can refer to stripe or paymill for the pricing. Venmo charges 3% if the users use credit card to pay, and Venmo encourages the users to use debit card or bank transfer in order to keep the fees low. So the card processing fees are high for all companies in the world. The disadvantage is no direct banking api for Singapore, but you can still use eNets (well, eNets is not so friendly too), anyway, it should not be the key point. Chinese banks have no banking api at the beginning, however, the banks made their api available when they found online e-commerce are growing so fast.</p>
<p>I think the biggest barrier is how you can get enough merchants and users at the beginning. You know, its a marketplace model like Uber, with both of sellers and buyers involved. You will have to get enough merchants before attracting your users to use your e-wallet, and there must be good enough users before persuading the merchants to offer your e-wallet as a payment option. Its very difficult to get good enough volume on both sides, especially at the beginning.</p>
<p> Paypal and Alipay started with online payments when the merchants have few options to collect online payments. Most merchants prefer to use them because they have no better options, so its not difficult for them to get their first merchants. They use their merchants to get their users, and then grow as the online e-commerce market grows. They start to come to offline when they become giant and many people are used to using them. However, you guys started with offline business first, which makes it more difficult when Singapore people are used to using cash or card for offline shopping and eating.</p>

<p>To answer your queries, we did not seek to equip merchants with smartphones & data plan because that would make for an unsustainable business both short- and long-term. The usage of PayPal was out of the question for us because of the fees: 3.9% +$0.50 works out to be 20.6% fees for a $3 meal. None of the merchants would be willing to pay 20.6% fees just for cashless payment collection, and it also defeats our goal of trying to engineer a low-cost payment solution.</p>
<p>As for your comments on NUS, I can share that NUS is a large organization with sub-divisions each having different agendas. The Office that introduced DBS PayLah into the ecosystem was trying to advance their cashless agenda in what they believe would be the fastest way, since DBS has the resources to incentivize consumer behaviour.

However, I also believe that while a company may clearly know very well what they sell, they may not always be aware of what their customers are buying from them. </p>
<p>I think this lack of insight and reflection on their business can result in the company being diverted from their core-strenghts and focus. For example, while one may say that Uber offers a taxi service, what their customers are buying is convenience and hassle free travel. </p>
<p>In my experience, companies that come into a market with a “me-too” product (copying a market leader) for a neglected market segment, their business decisions are not to improve what their customers are buying from them instead it is to improve their share of the market (which they ultimately lose because they are working to improve what their customers are buying)</p>

However, I also believe that while a company may clearly know very well what they sell, they may not always be aware of what their customers are buying from them. I think this lack of insight and reflection on their business can result in the company being diverted from their core-strenghts and focus. For example, while one may say that Uber offers a taxi service, what their customers are buying is convenience and hassle free travel. In my experience, companies that come into a market with a ""me-too"" product (copying a market leader) for a neglected market segment, their business decisions are not to improve what their customers are buying from them instead it is to improve their share of the market (which they ultimately lose because they are working to improve what their customers are buying)Would like to hear others thoughts on this too.

413890,313294,The worst ways to leave your developer job,https://www.techinasia.com/worst-ways-leave-developer-job,"<p>Definitely, feel that this article is kind of a sponsored one from the people who are sitting as employers and want to indirectly manipulate developers, to be developers or to be entrepreneurs. Techinasia is a platform where definitely both developers and to be entrepreneurs come and not already established owners of a software company. So it is in their best interest to float these kinds of theories and point by point reasons of indirect threatening about a developers future. Well people its like a relationship if you do not reciprocate respect for people working with or for you, you are destined to be left in the lurk.  But still some people will say “It is better to eat your ego, rather than having shit to eat”, this again is a threat of indirect kind, and where it comes from we all should know by now, the people who call themselves masters (employers) and us slaves (employees). If the developers are so important that their work can’t be picked up easily by a new person, then start respecting and monetarily recognizing them, if monetary aspect is a problem for a company in present, then give the developer an equity, he will be more than happy in making you succeed rather than just working or changing for salary hikes. If the employers are not even ready for this and still want you to continue than that’s a red flag about their intentions, which means they will throw you out and hire a cheaper resource for support once the actual creative software development job is done, to make some extra bucks. Something similar happened in US when outsourcing started to India, and it is repeating itself now when Indian develpers are getting replaced by cheaper options. My suggestion is go for the money until you find someone worthy of your presence in their team.</p>
","Definitely, feel that this article is kind of a sponsored one from the people who are sitting as employers and want to indirectly manipulate developers, to be developers or to be entrepreneurs. Techinasia is a platform where definitely both developers and to be entrepreneurs come and not already established owners of a software company. So it is in their best interest to float these kinds of theories and point by point reasons of indirect threatening about a developers future.

Just ask most Indonesian based start-ups ? even Gojek outsources their dev work to India. As computer engineering docs  are mostly  written in English, Indonesia should teach their people English first and this is the FOUNDATION to advance and keep abreast with fast-changing IT world once most Indonesians have embraced English  then they can talk about running start-ups, secure local data centers etc. People currently just don’t have confidence in local engineers in Indonesia. Most of them don’t speak English how can you create secure and scalable computer program if you don’t understand english ? Think about it. just copy and paste from Google as long as it works ? and this is what happens in Indonesia I witness this first hand they do this because they don’t have good grasp of English.

<p>There is a biased one sided view on this video pointing that only the male gender is responsible of sexual harassment, qualifying all mens as potential sexual harasser and rapist and requesting that we just “listen and believe” you when something supposedly happens to you.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that you ladies get away with a lot and in fact even too much when it comes to take responsibility of your bad behaviour.</p>

<p>Looking at things, it’s not by having more women in the tech field that this sexual harassment behaviour pointed towards men will stop, but will make it more difficult to believe you, especially in the rise of recent fake allegations cases made against mens.</p>
<p>Tech conferences and salons are becoming an open platform for you whining(again and again and again) about how mens are bad, they keep their privileges, ( do you expect Michael Jordan to give you his 6 rings and Championship titles ?), how you get no funding when in fact you bring no value in a competitive environment as we have yet to see a real innovation happening beyond an ecommerce/social platform.</p>
